## Summary

[myproject.page](http://myproject.page) is a website for people to showcase their projects and discover projects by peers. Unlike a website like Product Hunt for example, the focus is not on how unique or how viable (business wise) the product is, but on how well the project is made as far as technicalities and design goes.

A growing segment of the developer/designer/product market is looking for people with past projects having been made. A portfolio site where projects can be showcased, and also where great projects can be discovered can help foster this community.

## Features

### Portfolio Building

The first important part of this portal is to signup, create accounts and add projects. We will use 'login with CodingBlocks' to hasten the signup process.

Everyone gets a [myproject.page/@username](http://myproject.page/@username) format profile landing page where there is basic information about them, plus a list of their projects.

To add projects we need a high entry barrier, i.e. all details like title, description should have well defined min-max char count. Cover photo is important, options to add Youtube video, Github link etc should be available.

### Browse Projects

Once projects exist on the website, it is important to be able to browse projects, upvote/downvote them and discuss about them

We will take a imgur like approach where there will be pages like

[myproject.page/new](http://myproject.page/new)

[myproject.page/trending](http://myproject.page/trending)

[myproject.page/popular](http://myproject.page/popular)

Each project will be basically available in it's own landing page like [myproject.page/@username/proj-name-23b4j32](http://myproject.page/@username/proj-name-23b4j32)

On the project page we can integrate Disqus so people can comment on the projects as well. (or our own comment system too)

Browsing projects by hashtags is important as well. So that you can go to [myproject.page/#react](http://myproject.page/#react) for react projects.
